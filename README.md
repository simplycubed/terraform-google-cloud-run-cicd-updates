# Terraform Module: Google Cloud Run - CICD Updates

A Terraform module for the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) that simplifies the creation & configuration of a Cloud Run (Fully Managed) service.

## Important

- This module is designed to provision Cloud Run with Terraform and update the images using CI/CD pipelines.
- For Terraform-only managed deployments and updates please use [simplycubed/terraform-google-cloud-run](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-cloud-run) or the [source](https://github.com/garbetjie/terraform-google-cloud-run) project.

## Introduction

This module is wrapper around the creation & configuration of [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) (Fully
managed) services, and provides sensible defaults for many of the options.

It attempts to be as complete as possible, and expose as much functionality as is available.
As a result, some functionality might only be provided as part of BETA releases. Google's SLA support for this level of
functionality is often not as solid as with Generally-Available releases. If you require absolute stability, this module
might not be the best for you.

## Requirements

- Terraform 0.14 or higher.
- `google` provider 3.67.0 or higher.
- `google-beta` provider 3.67.0 or higher.

## Usage

```hcl-terraform
module my_cloud_run_service {
  source = "simplycubed/cloud-run-cicd-updates/google"
  version = "~> 2"
  
  # Required parameters
  name = "my-cloud-run-service"
  image = "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello"
  location = "europe-west4"
  
  # Optional parameters
  allow_public_access = true
  args = []
  cloudsql_connections = []
  concurrency = 80
  cpu_throttling = true
  cpus = 1
  entrypoint = []
  env = [{ key = "ENV_VAR_KEY", value = "ENV_VAR_VALUE" }]
  ingress = "all"
  labels = {}
  map_domains = []
  max_instances = 1000
  memory = 256
  min_instances = 0
  port = 8080
  project = null
  revision = null
  service_account_email = null
  timeout = 60
  volumes = [{ path = "/mnt", secret = "my-secret", filenames = { "latest" = "latest" }}]
  vpc_access = { connector = null, egress = null }
}
```

## Secrets & Volumes

If your service requires the use of sensitive values, it is possible to store them in [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)
and reference those secrets in your service. This will prevent the values of those secrets from being exposed to anyone
that might have access your service but not to the contents of the secrets.

Secrets can either be exposed as files through mounted volumes, or through environment variables. This can be configured
through the `volumes` and `env` input variables respectively.

> **Note:** Environment variables using the latest secret version will not be updated when a new version is added. Volumes
> using the latest version will have their contents automatically updated to reflect the latest secret version.

Refer to [Cloud Run > Documentation > Guides > Using secrets](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/secrets) for further reading on secrets in Cloud Run.
